    "short": "Giants of All Sizes are a 4-piece genre-bending band from the Philadelphia area. We play all kinds of music from funk to metal. If you can't find one song you like then you probably hate music.",
    "long": "Emerging from the suburbs of Montgomery County, Giants of All Sizes represents a new generation of Philadelphia rock. The quartet - Tommy Crotty (drums), Jakob Stein (guitar), Dylan Renner (bass), and Calvin Cooper (vocals/multi-instrumentalist) - refuses to be boxed into a single genre, instead creating a sound that spans from funk grooves to metal intensity.\n\nFormed in 2023, the band quickly developed a reputation for their high-energy live shows and eclectic setlists. Currently, they are harvesting the best musical fruits from Montgomery County, and preparing to deliver them directly to your streaming service of choice.\n\nTheir debut demos showcase the band's versatility and commitment to pushing musical boundaries while maintaining an infectious energy that gets crowds moving."
